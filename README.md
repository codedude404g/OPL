**first_class_functions.adb**
This is the ADA program of the first class functions.
It is from rosettacode.org/wiki/First-class_functions#Ada
I changed the sqr function to cube (but kept the name) and 
I implemented my own cube root function
*To run with GNAT:
gnatmake first_class_functions.adb
./first_class_functions 

**ocaml.ml**
This is an original program written in ocaml to demonstrate first class functions.
It uses sin, cos, and a cube function stored in a list and their inverses stored in a seperate list. It has a user defined cube and cube root function.
It composes the functions stored in the lists and prints out the difference between the composition result and the hard coded input value.
*To run with ocaml:
ocamlopt -o build ocaml.ml

**prolog.pl**
This is the prolog program demonstrating first class functions.
It is from rosettacode.org/wiki/First-class_functions#Prolog
It uses a module named lambda.pl that is included.
*To run with swi-prolog:
swipl
['lambda.pl'].
['prolog.pl'].
first_class.

**python**

using the lamda function was a bit challenging.

to run this program after locating the file on terminal, simply type "python3 main.py" then enter the value.

**C#**

this choice of programming langauge was not easy, since i have never worked on any of the choices given. so i used the sample code provided.I commented the code to show what i understand . i also run the code and was able to work withc# for first time.

Python was easier than C# .I will contue to practice to better understand c#.
